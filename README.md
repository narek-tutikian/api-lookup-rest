##Lookup for a particular IP address REST API

The implementation based on requirements

Implement REST API that allows users to:

- Lookup for a particular IP address info via https://ipwhois.io/ and store in to DB
- Response with a stored lookup info from DB in case the spefic IP was already searched (DB-caching)
- Remove cached result by IP

### Setup and run

- Clone the repo from Github
- run `yarn`
- run `yarn start`

No need for additional DB setup, It is a file stored in the runtime
